# JPA - Java Persistence API

-	Mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa is called Object-relational mapping (ORM)
-	The Java Persistence API (JPA) is one possible approach to ORM
-	Via JPA the developer can map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa
-	JPA can be used in Java-EE and Java-SE applications


-	JPA Specification:

	-	JPA is a specification and several implementations are available
	-	Popular implementations are Hibernate, EclipseLink and Apache OpenJPA
	
-	JPA permits the developer to work directly with objects rather than with SQL statements
-	The JPA implementation is typically called persistence provider


-	Persistence.xml

	-	The mapping between Java objects and database tables is defined via persistence metadata
	-	The JPA provider will use the persistence metadata information to perform the correct database operations
	
	
##	@Entity

-	A class which should be persisted in a database it must be annotated with javax.persistence.Entity
-	Such a class is called Entity. JPA uses a database table for every entity
-	Persisted instances of the class will be represented as one row in the table

-	All entity classes must define a primary key, must have a non-arg constructor and or not allowed to be final
-	Keys can be a single field or a combination of fields


-	@GeneratedValue:

	-	JPA allows to auto-generate the primary key in the database via the @GeneratedValue annotation
	
-	@Table:
		
	-	By default, the table name corresponds to the class name
	-	We can change this with the addition to the annotation @Table(name="NEWTABLENAME")
	

##	Entity Manager

-	The entity manager javax.persistence.EntityManager manages all operations from and to the database,
	-	e.g. find objects, persists them, remove objects from the database, etc.

-	In a JavaEE application the entity manager is automatically inserted in the web application
	-	Outside JavaEE we need to manage the entity manager ourself
	
-	The persistence context describes all Entities of one Entity manager
-	Entities which are managed by an Entity Manager will automatically propagate these changes to the database (if this happens within a commit statement). 
-	If the Entity Manager is closed (via close()) then the managed entities are in a detached state
-	To synchronize them again with the database a Entity Manager provides the merge() method

##	Persistence Context

-	Persistence Context is a set of entity instances where each entity will identified uniquely
-	The lifecycle of entity instances is managed within the persistence context using the EntityManager
-	We can detach and merge the entity instances within a persistence context


##	 Persistence units

-	The EntityManager is created by the EntityManagerFactory which is configured by the persistence unit
-	The persistence unit is described via the persistence.xml file in the META-INF directory of the source folder
-	A set of entities which are logical connected will be grouped via a persistence unit
-	The persistence.xml file defines the connection data to the database, e.g. the driver, the user and the password


##	Persistence of fields

-	The fields of the Entity will be saved in the database
-	JPA can use either your instance variables (fields) or the corresponding getters and setters to access the fields
- 	We are not allowed to mix both methods
-	If we want to use the setter and getter methods the Java class must follow the Java Bean naming conventions


-	@Id

	-	Identifies the unique ID of the database entry
	-	Defines the field as the primary key
	
-	@Transient:

	-	 JPA  by default persists all fields of an Entity, if fields should not be saved they must be marked with @Transient

-	@Column
	
	-	By default each field is mapped to a column with the name of the field
	-	We can change the default name via @Column (name="newColumnName")
	
	
##	JPA Benefits
	
-	The benefit of using the JPA framework over any specific Object Relational Model (ORM) related libraries like Hibernate, iBatis etc. is that developers do not change the code when they migrating to different vendor
-	The code is loosely coupled with the underlying ORM framework and Applications
