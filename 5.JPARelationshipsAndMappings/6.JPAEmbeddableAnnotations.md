#	JPA Embeddable Annotation


-	Embeddable annotation is used instances as part of intrinsic part of an owning entity and share the identity of the entity
-	Each of the persistent properties or fields of the embedded object is mapped to the database table for the entity

![Person Entity](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/persontable.png)

-	Corresponding PersonEntity in JPA will be

			@Entity
			public class Person {

				@Id
				private String idperson;
				private String name;
					private String area;
					private String city;
					private String pincode;

					// getters and setters

			}
		
-	We can declare Address class as being embeddable into some other entity. So it class becomes	

			@Embeddable
			public class Address {
			 
				private String area;
				private String city;
				private String pincode;		
				
			}



			@Entity
			public class Person {
			 
				@TableGenerator(name = "person_gen", table = "id_gen", pkColumnName = "gen_name", valueColumnName = "gen_val", allocationSize = 100)
				@Id
				@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "person_gen")
				private String idperson;
				private String name;
				
				@Embedded
				private Address address;
				
			}	
			
			
			
			
-	Persisting Person
		
		
				/* Create EntityManagerFactory */
				EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence
						.createEntityManagerFactory("embeddabledemo");

				/* Create EntityManager */
				EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();

				EntityTransaction transaction = em.getTransaction();

				transaction.begin();

				Person prasad = new Person();
				prasad.setName("prasad");

				Address address = new Address();
				address.setArea("Pimple Saudagar");
				address.setCity("pune");
				address.setPincode("411 027");

				prasad.setAddress(address);

				em.persist(prasad);

				transaction.commit();
				
				
##	Embeddable Objects:				
				
-	An embedded object specified using jpa embeddable annotation does not represent a table in database
-	It is not an Entity. It is simply owned by some Entity and it forms the field names of owning entity.
-	As Address is not an Entity, the relationship between Person and Address is not termed a a jpa relationship. It is simply an embedded object.
-	The purpose of embedded objects is re-usability. We can re-use address embedded object for some other class which has also the same fields in database representation.
