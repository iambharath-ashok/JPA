#	JPA @IdClass example

-	Database table can contain compound primary keys. i.e. the primary key is composed of more than one columns
-	Compound primary keys can be created in JPA in two ways, using @IdClass and @EmbeddedId annotation


##	JPA @IdClass example

-	Consider an Employee entity such that:

	-	The primary key of Employee table is composed of two columns.
	-	The columns are idEmployee and branchName
	-	The combination of idEmployee and branchName collectively makes the primary key
	
-	In database, Employee table is as depicted:

![EmployeeEntity IdClass](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/EmployeeEntity.png)

-	We can create compound primary keys in JPA using @IdClass annotation and corresponding java id class
-	Note that for this JPA @IdClass example, we have specified @IdClass(EmployeeId.class) for the Employee entity; 
	-	Meaning it should use specified class objects as primary key.


			@Entity
			@IdClass(EmployeeId.class)
			public class Employee {
			 
				@Id
				private String branchName;
				@Id
				private int idEmployee;
			 
				private String firstName;
				private String lastName;
				private int salary;
			 
			}
			
			public class EmployeeId implements Serializable {
 
				private int idEmployee;
				private String branchName;
			 
				public EmployeeId() {
			 
				}
			 
				public EmployeeId(String branchName, int idEmployee) {
					this.branchName = branchName;
					this.idEmployee = idEmployee;
				}
			 
				public int getIdEmployee() {
					return idEmployee;
				}
			 
				public String getBranchName() {
					return branchName;
				}
			 
				@Override
				public int hashCode() {
					final int prime = 31;
					int result = 1;
					result = prime * result
							+ ((branchName == null) ? 0 : branchName.hashCode());
					result = prime * result + idEmployee;
					return result;
				}
			 
				@Override
				public boolean equals(Object obj) {
					if (this == obj)
						return true;
					if (obj == null)
						return false;
					if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
						return false;
					EmployeeId other = (EmployeeId) obj;
					if (branchName == null) {
						if (other.branchName != null)
							return false;
					} else if (!branchName.equals(other.branchName))
						return false;
					if (idEmployee != other.idEmployee)
						return false;
					return true;
				}				
			}
	

## Points about IdClass Example:

-	The primary key class, in this case EmployeeId must contain fields that match the fields annotated with @Id in entity class
-	So, primary class contains fields branchName and idEmployee as they are annotated with @Id  in Employee entity
-	There are no setter methods for EmployeeId class for obvious reason that primary key values should not be changed
-	We should override equals() and hashcode()  as these primary key objects need to be identified uniquely and we can use them in collections those use hashing


##	Query to find the Employee using Compound Primary Keys

-	Now we can check this jpa @IdClass example by trying to find an Employee with a specific branchName and idEmployee
		
			
			EmployeeId employeeId = new EmployeeId("pune", 1);
			Employee emp = em.find(Employee.class, employeeId);
			System.out.println("First name = " + emp.getFirstName() + " "
				+ "Last Name = " + emp.getLastName() + " " + "salary = "
				+ emp.getSalary());



-	First name = Prasad Last Name = Kharkar salary = 100000
