# Types of EntityManagers

-	The EntityManager class is the main API in JPA
- 	It is used to create new entities, manufacture queries to return sets of existing entities, merge in the state of remotely modified entities, delete entities from the database, and more


-	There are two main kinds of entity managers:
	
	-	1.	Container Managed
		-	The managed entity managers may only be obtained within a container that supports the JPA Service Provider Interface.
		-	Container manages all the transactions
		-	Persistence context will injected from Container
		-	container Managed EntityManager can be obtained only in standard Java EE Container (or containers that are compliant to the JPA container contract)
		
				@Repository
				public class MyBean implements MyInterface {
				
						@PersistenceContext(unitName="PetShop")
						EntityManager em;
						...
				}
		
			
	-	2.	Non-Managed
		-	Non-managed entity managers may be obtained in any environment where a JPA provider is on the classpath
		-	In Non-Managed environment, entity manager will be obtained by first creating the EntityManagerFactory using Persistence root class using persistence unit name.
				
				
				
				import javax.persistence.*;
				...
				EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("PetShop");
				EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
				...
				em.close();


				
##	Using an Entity Manager

-	Depending upon the EntityManager type, whether its a Container Managed or Non-Managed, entity manager transaction management changes

	-	Container Managed Entity Manager
	
				public Pet createPet(int idNum, String name, PetType type) {
					Pet pet = new Pet(idNum, name, type);
					em.persist(pet);
					return pet;
				}
				
				public Pet findPet(int id) {
					return em.find(Pet.class, id);
				}
				
				public Pet changeName(int id, String newName) {
					Pet pet = this.findPet(id);
					pet.setName(newName);
					return pet;
				}
				
				public void deletePet(int id) {
					Pet pet = this.findPet(id);
					em.remove(pet);
				}


		-	Note that finding the pet is the first step to being able to perform update and delete operations on it. 
		-	Also, an update does not even involve invoking the entity manager, but requires reading the pet, loading it into the entity manager and then modifying it. 
		-	The modification will be reflected in the database when the transaction is committed.
		
	-	Non-Managed Entity Manager
	
			public Pet createPet(int idNum, String name, PetType type) 
			{
				em.getTransaction().begin();
				Pet pet = new Pet(idNum, name, type);
				em.persist(pet);
				em.getTransaction().commit();
				return pet;
			}
