#	JPA Table Per Concrete Class

![JPA Table Per Concrete Class](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VehicleClassDiagram.png)

-	Class diagram for JPA table per concrete class example says:

	-	Vehicle is an abstract class with fields idVehicle and manufacturer.
	-	TransportationVehicle and PassengerVehicle are also abstract classes with fields loadCapacity and noOfPassengers respectively.
	-	Truck, Car and Bike are concrete classes with noOfContainers, noOfDoors and saddleHeight as their respective properties.
	
#	Vehicle class

-	@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS) defines the strategy for jpa table per concrete class example.
-	Note that there is no @Table annotation for Vehicle as it is abstract class and will not have its representation in database.
-	@TableGenerator and @GeneratedValue are used for automatic id creation.
		 
			@Entity
			@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
			public abstract class Vehicle {
			 
				@TableGenerator(name = "VEHICLE_GEN", table = "ID_GEN", pkColumnName = "GEN_NAME", valueColumnName = "GEN_VAL", allocationSize = 1)
				@Id
				@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "VEHICLE_GEN")
				private int idVehicle;
				private String manufacturer;
				
				
			}

##	TransportationVehicle class
	
-	TransportationVehicle is an abstract class hence will not be mapped to table
	
		@MappedSuperclass
		public abstract class TransportationVehicle extends Vehicle {
		 
			private int loadCapacity;
		 
			public int getLoadCapacity() {
				return loadCapacity;
			}
		 
			public void setLoadCapacity(int loadCapacity) {
				this.loadCapacity = loadCapacity;
			}
		 
		}
		
		
##	 Truck class

-	Truck is a concrete class and will be mapped to table in DB
		
		@Entity
		public class Truck extends TransportationVehicle {
		 
			private int noOfContainers;
		 
			public int getNoOfContainers() {
				return noOfContainers;
			}
		 
			public void setNoOfContainers(int noOfContainers) {
				this.noOfContainers = noOfContainers;
			}
		 
		}
		
		
##	PassengerVehicle class
				
-	PassengerVehicle is a abstract will not mapped to table in db				
				
		 
		@MappedSuperclass
		public abstract class PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle {
		 
			private int noOfpassengers;
		 
			public int getNoOfpassengers() {
				return noOfpassengers;
			}
		 
			public void setNoOfpassengers(int noOfpassengers) {
				this.noOfpassengers = noOfpassengers;
			}
		 
		}		
		
		
##	 Car class

-	Car is a concrete class and will be mapped to table in DB

		Entity
		ublic class Car extends PassengerVehicle {
		
			private int noOfDoors;
		
			public int getNoOfDoors() {
				return noOfDoors;
			}
		
			public void setNoOfDoors(int noOfDoors) {
				this.noOfDoors = noOfDoors;
			}
		
##	 Bike class
	
-	Bike is a concrete class and will be mapped to table in DB	
		
	@Entity
	public class Bike extends PassengerVehicle {
	 
		private int saddleHeight;
	 
		public int getSaddleHeight() {
			return saddleHeight;
		}
	 
		public void setSaddleHeight(int saddleHeight) {
			this.saddleHeight = saddleHeight;
		}
	 
	}	
	
##	We can notice in this jpa table per concrete class example:

-	Vehicle, TransportationVehicle and PassengerVehicle are abstract classes and they will not have separate table in database.
-	Truck, Car and Bike are concrete classes so they will be mapped to corresponding tables. These tables should include all the fields for classes annotated with @MappedSuperClass because they donâ€™t have corresponding tables in database.
-	So, Truck table will have columns to store fields inherited from TransportationVehicle and Vehicle.
-	Similarly, Car and Bike will have columns to store fields inherited from PassengerVehicle and Vehicle.


##	Database for jpa table per concrete class example becomes as follows.

##	Testing this jpa table per concrete class example


			/* Create EntityManagerFactory */
			EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence
				.createEntityManagerFactory("AdvancedMapping");

			/* Create EntityManager */
			EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();

			EntityTransaction transaction = em.getTransaction();

			transaction.begin();

			Bike cbr1000rr = new Bike();
			cbr1000rr.setManufacturer("honda");
			cbr1000rr.setNoOfpassengers(1);
			cbr1000rr.setSaddleHeight(30);
			em.persist(cbr1000rr);

			Car aventador = new Car();
			aventador.setManufacturer("lamborghini");
			aventador.setNoOfDoors(2);
			aventador.setNoOfpassengers(2);
			em.persist(aventador);

			Truck truck = new Truck();
			truck.setLoadCapacity(1000);
			truck.setManufacturer("volvo");
			truck.setNoOfContainers(2);
			em.persist(truck);

			transaction.commit();
			
			
##	Truck table

idVehicle|	manufacturer	|loadCapacity	|noOfContainers
---------|------------|-------------------|--------------
14	|volvo	|1000	|2			

##	Car table


idVehicle|	manufacturer	|	NoOfpassengers |NoOfDoors
---------|------------|-------------------|--------------
13	|lamborghini	|2	|2


##	Bike table

idVehicle|	manufacturer	|NoOfpassengers	|SaddleHeight
---------|------------|-------------------|--------------
12 |	honda|	1	|30
