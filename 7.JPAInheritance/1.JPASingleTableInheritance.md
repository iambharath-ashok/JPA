#	JPA Inheritance

-	Ideally in JPA, we map entities with table
-	But what happens when inheritance comes into picture? 
-	How can we map entity hierarchies into database? 
-	There are various ways of mapping inheritance to database


##	JPA Single Table Inheritance


![JPA Single Table Inheritance](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VehicleClassDiagram.png)

-	This is what class diagram in this JPA single table inheritance example says:

	-	Vehicle is an abstract class with fields idVehicle and manufacturer
	-	TransportationVehicle and PassengerVehicle are also abstract classes with fields loadCapacity and noOfPassengers respectively
	-	Truck, Car and Bike are concrete classes with noOfContainers, noOfDoors and saddleHeight as their respective properties
	



-	As the names suggests, in single table inheritance only one table will store all the fields of all classes that come in hierarchy
-	We have to create table as per above image

![JPA Single Table Inheritance](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VehicleTable.png)

-	It is obvious that:
	
	-	idVehicle and manufacturer columns correspond to Vehicle class and these fields are inherited by all subclasses.These columns will have values for all types of vehicles, i.e. Car, Truck and Bike
	-	loadCapacity  is field of class TransportationVehicle and will be inherited by Truck. So all trucks will have a value in row for this column.
	-	noOfPassengers is field of class PassengerVehicle and will be inherited by Car and Bike. So all cars and bikes will have a value for this column.
	-	noOfContainers, noOfDoors and saddleHeight will have values that are only specific to Truck, Car and Bike respectively as these fields are unique to them.
	-	There is an extra column called vehicle_type in table. This is used to identify the type of object in entity model. It will store values those are specific to classes. It is called as Discriminator column.
	
	
##	Discriminator Column:

-	Is used to define the discriminator column for the SINGLE_TABLE and JOINED inheritance mapping strategies
-	The strategy and the discriminator column are only specified in the root of an entity class hierarchy or subhierarchy in which a different inheritance strategy is applied	


-	For our Vehicle model, it is done using.

			@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "VEHICLE_TYPE")
			public abstract class Vehicle {
				//Vehicle class code
			}


			@Entity
			@Table(name = "VEHICLE")
			@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
			@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "VEHICLE_TYPE")
			public abstract class Vehicle {
			 
				@TableGenerator(name = "VEHICLE_GEN", table = "ID_GEN", pkColumnName = "GEN_NAME", valueColumnName = "GEN_VAL", allocationSize = 1)
				@Id
				@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "VEHICLE_GEN")
				private int idVehicle;
				private String manufacturer;
			 
				public int getIdVehicle() {
					return idVehicle;
				}
			 
				public void setIdVehicle(int idVehicle) {
					this.idVehicle = idVehicle;
				}
			 
				public String getManufacturer() {
					return manufacturer;
				}
			 
				public void setManufacturer(String manufacturer) {
					this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
				}
			 
			}
			
			
-	Vehicle class is abstract but it is our root entity and inheritance starts from here, hence it needs to be annotated with @Inheritance
-  	@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)  specifies we are using single table strategy
-	@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "VEHICLE_TYPE") specifies the name of discriminator column which stores the values to identify type of entity in database
-	@GeneratedValue and @TableGenarator are used to create automatic id using table generator


##	MappedSuperClass annotation:

-	Classes annotated with @MappedSuperClass are like abstract classes in java
-	They are non persistent.
-	They cannot be queried over and are not mapped to any database table.
-	They are only used to contribute state and behavior to entities those are inherited from them.
-	It is good practice to mark abstract classes as @MappedSuperClass in jpa inheritance.
-	In our case, annotating TransportationVehicle and PassengerVehicle as @MappedSuperClass enables Truck, Car and Bike classes to hold their state


				@MappedSuperclass
				public abstract class TransportationVehicle extends Vehicle {
				 
					private int loadCapacity;
				 
					public int getLoadCapacity() {
						return loadCapacity;
					}
				 
					public void setLoadCapacity(int loadCapacity) {
						this.loadCapacity = loadCapacity;
					}
				 
				}

				
				@MappedSuperclass
				public abstract class PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle {
				 
					private int noOfpassengers;
				 
					public int getNoOfpassengers() {
						return noOfpassengers;
					}
				 
					public void setNoOfpassengers(int noOfpassengers) {
						this.noOfpassengers = noOfpassengers;
					}
				 
				}
	
##	DiscriminatorValue annotation:

-	Is used to specify the value of the discriminator column for entities of the given type.
- 	The DiscriminatorValue annotation can only be specified on a concrete entity class.
- 	If the DiscriminatorValue annotation is not specified and a discriminator column is used, 
	-	A provider-specific function will be used to generate a value representing the entity type. 
-	If the DiscriminatorType is STRING, the discriminator value default is the entity name

	-	In our jpa single table inheritance example, we have specified discriminator value such that:
		-	when a bike instance is persisted, database row corresponding to that instance will have value “Bike” in column vehicle_type.
		-	Similarly “Car” is persisted for car instance and “Truck” for a truck instance.
		-	Values from discriminator column i.e vehicle_type enables jpa identify the type of object.
		
		
		
			/* Create EntityManagerFactory */
			EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence
						.createEntityManagerFactory("AdvancedMapping");

			/* Create EntityManager */
			EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
			EntityTransaction transaction = em.getTransaction();
			transaction.begin();

			Bike cbr1000rr = new Bike();
			cbr1000rr.setManufacturer("honda");
			cbr1000rr.setNoOfpassengers(1);
			cbr1000rr.setSaddleHeight(30);
			em.persist(cbr1000rr);

			Car avantador = new Car();
			avantador.setManufacturer("lamborghini");
			avantador.setNoOfDoors(2);
			avantador.setNoOfpassengers(2);
			em.persist(avantador);

			Truck truck = new Truck();
			truck.setLoadCapacity(100);
			truck.setManufacturer("mercedes");
			truck.setNoOfContainers(2);
			em.persist(truck);

			transaction.commit();

-	The advantage of single table strategy is it does not require complex joins for retrieval and insertion of entities
-	But on the other hand it wastes database space as many columns need to be nullable and there isn’t any data for them
