#	PA Joined Inheritance 


![JPA Joined Inheritance](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/VehicleClassDiagram.png)

-	Class diagram for JPA joined inheritance example says:

	-		Vehicle is an abstract class with fields idVehicle and manufacturer.
	-		TransportationVehicle and PassengerVehicle are also abstract classes with fields loadCapacity and noOfPassengers respectively.
	-		Truck, Car and Bike are concrete classes with noOfContainers, noOfDoors and saddleHeight as their respective properties.
	
##	Vehicle.java

-	@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED) specifies we are creating joined inheritance
-	@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "VEHICLE_TYPE") specifies database column that stores information about type of entities
-	@TableGenerator and @GeneratedValue are used for automatic id creation in jpa
-	Vehicle will be mapped to table in DB and will store information about rows of concrete entities

			@Entity
			@Table(name = "VEHICLE")
			@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
			@DiscriminatorColumn(name = "VEHICLE_TYPE")
			public abstract class Vehicle {
			 
				@TableGenerator(name = "VEHICLE_GEN", table = "ID_GEN", pkColumnName = "GEN_NAME", valueColumnName = "GEN_VAL", allocationSize = 1)
				@Id
				@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "VEHICLE_GEN")
				private int idVehicle;
				private String manufacturer;
				
			}	
			
			
##	TransportationVehicle.java

-	TransportationVehicle is a abstract class and there will no mapping for this class in table


			import javax.persistence.MappedSuperclass;
 
			@MappedSuperclass
			public abstract class TransportationVehicle extends Vehicle {
			 
				private int loadCapacity;
			 
				public int getLoadCapacity() {
					return loadCapacity;
				}
			 
				public void setLoadCapacity(int loadCapacity) {
					this.loadCapacity = loadCapacity;
				}
			 
			}	
			
			
##	Truck.java
					
-	Truck is a Concreate class and will be mapped to table in DB
	
			import javax.persistence.Entity;
 
			@Entity
			public class Truck extends TransportationVehicle {
			 
				private int noOfContainers;
			 
				public int getNoOfContainers() {
					return noOfContainers;
				}
			 
				public void setNoOfContainers(int noOfContainers) {
					this.noOfContainers = noOfContainers;
				}
			 
			}		
			
			
			
			
##	PassengerVehicle.java

-	PassengerVehicle is a abstract class and there will no mapping for this class in table


			@MappedSuperclass
			public abstract class PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle {
			 
				private int noOfpassengers;
			 
				public int getNoOfpassengers() {
					return noOfpassengers;
				}
			 
				public void setNoOfpassengers(int noOfpassengers) {
					this.noOfpassengers = noOfpassengers;
				}
			 
			}
			
##	Car.java	

-	Car will mapped to a table in db with a descriminator value car

			@Entity
			public class Car extends PassengerVehicle {
			 
				private int noOfDoors;
			 
				public int getNoOfDoors() {
					return noOfDoors;
				}
			 
				public void setNoOfDoors(int noOfDoors) {
					this.noOfDoors = noOfDoors;
				}
			 
			}


##	Bike.java			


-	BIke will mapped to a table in db with a descriminator value bike


			import javax.persistence.Entity;
 
			@Entity
			public class Bike extends PassengerVehicle {
			 
				private int saddleHeight;
			 
				public int getSaddleHeight() {
					return saddleHeight;
				}
			 
				public void setSaddleHeight(int saddleHeight) {
					this.saddleHeight = saddleHeight;
				}
			 
			}
			
			
			
##	Things to notice here:

-	Vehicle is an abstract class but every vehicle needs to be identified by jpa hence it should have an id and hence it becomes an entity that has representation in database. So database will have a table mapped to Vehicle class.
-	TransportationVehicle and PassengerVehicle are abstract but we have mapped them as @MappedSuperClass. They will have not separate table mapped in database. But they have fields loadCapacity and noOfPassengers respectively. So we need to create them in database tables those are mapped to subclasses.
-	So, there will be a table named Truck with column loadCapacity (represents  field inherited from mapped superclass TransportationVehicle) and noOfContainers.
-	A table named Car with column noOfPassengers(represents field inherited from mapped superclass PassengerVehicle) and noOfDoors.
-	A table named Bike with column noOfPassengers(represents field inherited from mapped superclass Passengervehicle) and saddleHeight.
-	Now there are four tables, Vehicle, Truck, Car and Bike. As the name JPA joined inheritance example obviously suggests, they need to be joined so that inheritance relationship is maintained.
-	Hence, subclass entities will have primary keys that will refer to primary keys of parent i.e. Vehicle class using foreign key relationship.			


[Inheritanc](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JPAJoinedInheritanceExample.png)

-	Vehicle table stores information about Vehicle class.
-	Truck table stores information about Truck class with inherited field from TransportationVehicle
-	Car and Bike tables store information about themselves and inherited field from PassengerVehicle
-	Primary keys of Truck, Car and Bike class are actually foreign keys that refer to primary keys of Vehicle. so subclass specific information can be accessed from superclass using foreign keys.



##	Persisting Joined Inheritance

	
		/* Create EntityManagerFactory */
		EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence
				.createEntityManagerFactory("AdvancedMapping");

		/* Create EntityManager */
		EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
		EntityTransaction transaction = em.getTransaction();

		transaction.begin();

		Bike cbr1000rr = new Bike();
		cbr1000rr.setManufacturer("honda");
		cbr1000rr.setNoOfpassengers(1);
		cbr1000rr.setSaddleHeight(30);
		em.persist(cbr1000rr);

		Car aventador = new Car();
		aventador.setManufacturer("lamborghini");
		aventador.setNoOfDoors(2);
		aventador.setNoOfpassengers(2);
		em.persist(aventador);

		Truck truck = new Truck();
		truck.setLoadCapacity(1000);
		truck.setManufacturer("volvo");
		truck.setNoOfContainers(2);
		em.persist(truck);

		transaction.commit();
		
		
##	Vehicle Table:
idvehicle |	manufacturer	|vehicle_type
--------|---------------|--------------
9	|honda	| Bike
10	|lamborghini	|Car
11	|volvo	|Truck


##	Bike Table


idvehicle	|noOfPassengers	|saddleHeight
-----------|----------------|-----------
9	|1	|30


##	Car Table:

idvehicle|	noOfPassengers|	noOfDoors
-----------|----------------|-----------
10	|2	|2


##	Truck Table:

idvehicle|	noOfPassengers|	noOfDoors
-----------|----------------|-----------
11 |1000|	2
