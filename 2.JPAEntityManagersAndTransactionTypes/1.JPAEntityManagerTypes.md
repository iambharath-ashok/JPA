# Types of EntityManagers

-	The EntityManager class is the main API in JPA
- 	It is used to create new entities, manufacture queries to return sets of existing entities, merge in the state of remotely modified entities, delete entities from the database, and more


-	There are two main kinds of entity managers:
	
	-	1.	Container Managed
		-	The managed entity managers may only be obtained within a container that supports the JPA Service Provider Interface.
		-	Container manages all the transactions
		-	Persistence context will injected from Container
		-	container Managed EntityManager can be obtained only in standard Java EE Container (or containers that are compliant to the JPA container contract)
		
				@Repository
				public class MyBean implements MyInterface {
				
						@PersistenceContext(unitName="PetShop")
						EntityManager em;
						...
				}
				
		-	When find method is invoked, container checks for available transaction.
		-	Then it checks for persistence context. 
		-	As there isnâ€™t one right now, container managed persistence context creates one and finds the project as per id
		-	While searching for employee, it checks the transaction again and finds one which was created to find project
		
			
	-	2.	Non-Managed or Application Managed
	
		-	Non-managed entity managers may be obtained in any environment where a JPA provider is on the classpath
		-	In Non-Managed environment, entity manager will be obtained by first creating the EntityManagerFactory using Persistence root class using persistence unit name
		-	An application managed entitymanager is created by explicitly invoking  createEntityManager();  method on  EntityManagerFactory  instance
			
			-	Instead of injecting an EntityManager , we inject an EntityManagerFactory .
			-	We manually create an  EntityManager prior to performing entity operations.
			-	We have to manage the lifecycle of application managed entitymanager.
			-	Applicaction managed entitymanager does not propogate throughout the application.
			-	To share the persistence context, we need to share EntityManager instance.
				
				
				
						import javax.persistence.*;
						...
						EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("PetShop");
						EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
						...
						em.close();
						
						
						public class DepartmentManagerBean implements DepartManager {
		 
							@PersistenceUnit(unitName="EmployeeService")
							EntityManagerFactory emf;
							
							EntityManager em;
							Department dept;
						 
							public void init(int deptId){
						 
								em = emf.createEntityManager();
								dept = em.find(Department.class, deptId);
							}
						 
							public void addEmployee(int empId){
								Employee emp = em.find(Employee.class, empId);
								dept.getEmployees().add(emp);
								emp.setDepartment(dept);
							}
						 
						}
						
						
			-	em = emf.createEntityManager();method create application managed entitymanager from  EntityManagerFactoryinstance			

	-	3.	Extended Entity Manager
	
		-	Default transaction attribute for every transactional method is REQUIRED.
		-	Whenever a method is invoked, a new transaction is created and entity manager will use a different persistence context each time
		-	This scenario is not suitable for stateful beans
			-	In stateful beans transaction states will be saved be saved b/w multiple sessions
			-	Entities will be saved b/w multiple transactions
		-	To resolve this issue, extended entitymanager was created. It prevents entities from being detached when transactions end
		
			-	Let us consider an example of Stateful Session bean.


						public class DepartmentManagerBean implements DepartManager {
 
							@PersistenceContext(unitName = "EmployeeService", type = PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)
							EntityManager em;
						 
							Department dept;
						 
							public void init(int deptId){
								dept = em.find(Department.class, deptId);
							}
						 
							public void setName(String name){
								dept.setName(name);
							}
						 
							public void addEmployee(int empId){
								Employee employee = em.find(Employee.class, empId);
								dept.getEmployees().add(emp);
								emp.setDepartment(dept);
							}
						}
						
		-	@PersistenceContext(unitName = "EmployeeService", type = PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)
		-	Extended entitymanager creates a persistence context when this stateful bean is created
		-	The persistence context will last entire conversation because the persistence context that manages the department object is still managed by extended entitymanager.
		-	Extended EntityManager requires a stateful session bean for operation.
			 
				
##	Using an Entity Manager

-	Depending upon the EntityManager type, whether its a Container Managed or Non-Managed, entity manager transaction management changes

	-	Container Managed Entity Manager
	
				public Pet createPet(int idNum, String name, PetType type) {
					Pet pet = new Pet(idNum, name, type);
					em.persist(pet);
					return pet;
				}
				
				public Pet findPet(int id) {
					return em.find(Pet.class, id);
				}
				
				public Pet changeName(int id, String newName) {
					Pet pet = this.findPet(id);
					pet.setName(newName);
					return pet;
				}
				
				public void deletePet(int id) {
					Pet pet = this.findPet(id);
					em.remove(pet);
				}


		-	Note that finding the pet is the first step to being able to perform update and delete operations on it. 
		-	Also, an update does not even involve invoking the entity manager, but requires reading the pet, loading it into the entity manager and then modifying it. 
		-	The modification will be reflected in the database when the transaction is committed.
		
	-	Non-Managed Entity Manager
	
			public Pet createPet(int idNum, String name, PetType type) 
			{
				em.getTransaction().begin();
				Pet pet = new Pet(idNum, name, type);
				em.persist(pet);
				em.getTransaction().commit();
				return pet;
			}
	
			






##	Choosing EntityManager

-	For Container or J2EE Applications:

	-	Container managed, transaction scoped entitymanagers are best suited for most of the JEE applications.
	-	Java EE applications need combination of flexible transaction propogation.
	-	So while choosing entitymanager for java EE applications, transaction scoped entitymanagers are the best choice.
	
-	Extended Entity Managers:	
	
	-	Consider a scenario in which you want the persistence context to be tied to a stateful session bean.
	-	The advantage of this persistence context is that the entities are managed even if transaction is committed.
	-	Choosing entitymanager of type extended becomes an obvious choice for such scenario

-	J2SE Applications:

	-	Application managed entitymanagers are rarely used in enterprise applications
	-	Those are not propogated and need to be shared to be able to access throughout the application
	-	Choosing entitymanager of this type is suitable for javaSE applications where entitymanager lifecycle is managed by the application
