# JPA Transactions

-	JPA supports two different kinds of transactions
	
	-	1.	JTA container transactions: Used when running in container mode
	-	2.	Resource local transactions:	Typically used when running in non-container mode.
	
	
	
-	1.	JTA transactions:
	
	-	JTA transactions are started and committed using the usual container techniques
	-	Either calling the UserTransaction API or making use of container-managed transaction demarcation in EJB or Spring
	-	In Container transactions, transaction will be started in the beginning of the method and committed at the end of the transactions
	-	Container Transactions requires @Required attribute setting on the @Transactional Annotation
			
			
				public Pet createPet(int idNum, String name, PetType type) {
					Pet pet = new Pet(idNum, name, type);
					em.persist(pet);
					return pet;
				}
				
				public Pet findPet(int id) {
					return em.find(Pet.class, id);
				}
				
				public Pet changeName(int id, String newName) {
					Pet pet = this.findPet(id);
					pet.setName(newName);
					return pet;
				}
				
				public void deletePet(int id) {
					Pet pet = this.findPet(id);
					em.remove(pet);
				}
	
-	2.	Resource local transactions

	-	In local transactions the transaction must be demarcated manually by invoking on the EntityTransaction instance accessed from the entity manager
	-	Each of the three methods above that caused the database to change would need to have begin and commit calls, as shown below for the persist method
	-	Methods that only read from the database do not need to occur within a transaction.
	
			public Pet createPet(int idNum, String name, PetType type) 
			{
				em.getTransaction().begin();
				Pet pet = new Pet(idNum, name, type);
				em.persist(pet);
				em.getTransaction().commit();
				return pet;
			}
