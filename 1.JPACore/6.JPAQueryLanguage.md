#  Java Persistence Query Language 

-	The Java Persistence Query Language is SQL-like, but operates over the entities and their properties instead of the SQL schema. 
-	Many of the SQL functions and even reserved words are supported in JP QL
-	Dynamic queries are objects that are created from an entity manager, and then executed
-	The query is specified at creation time as a Java Persistence Query Language (JP QL) string


##	Creating and executing a dynamic query

	Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Pet p");
	q.setMaxResults(100);
	List results = q.getResultList();
	
	
##	Named query

-	A named query is a query that is defined statically and then instantiated and executed at runtime
-	It can be defined as an annotation on the entity class, and assigned a name that is used when the query is created. Listing 8 shows a named query defined on the Pet entity

			
			@NamedQuery(name="Pet.findByName",
			query="SELECT p FROM Pet p WHERE p.name LIKE :pname")
			@Entity
			public class Pet {
				...
			}
			
-	The last identifier is prefixed with a colon (:) character to indicate that it is a named parameter that must be bound at runtime before the query can be executed
				
			
			public List findAllPetsByName(String petName) {
				Query q = em.createNamedQuery("Pet.findByName");
				q.setParameter("pname", petName);
				return q.getResultList();
			}	
			
			
-	Named queries are not only more efficient than dynamic queries but are also safer since they will often get pre-compiled by the persistence implementation at deployment time
