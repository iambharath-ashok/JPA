# JPA GROUP BY clause

-	Group by clause is used to aggregate the results
-	Group by clause provides many grouping clauses like max(), min(), avg(), count(), sum()
-	JPA Group By clause defines the grouping expressions over which the results will be aggregated. 
-	A grouping expression is single valued path expression variable or an identification variable

-	Data in Teacher table is as follows:

Teacher Id| Name | Salary | Department Id
----|---------------|----|-------
3	|Prasad	Kharkar	|20000	|6
4	|Sushsant	Pangarkar	|40000	|6
5	|Pranil	Gilda	20000	|8


-	Data in Department table is as follows:

Department Id | Department Name
----|------------
4	|Mathematics
6	|Science
8	|Language


-	Now consider we want to count the number of teacher by each department.
- 	We can use JPA GROUP BY clause for the same. The query would be as follows.

		SELECT d.name, count(t) FROM Department d INNER JOIN d.teachers t GROUP BY d.name;
		
		
		Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT d.name, COUNT(t) FROM Department d JOIN d.teachers t GROUP BY d.name");

		List<Object[]> results = query.getResultList();

			for (int i = 0; i < results.size(); i++) {
				Object[] arr = results.get(i);
				for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
					System.out.print(arr[j] + " ");
				}
				System.out.println();
				}

		
-	This will print results as follows.

	
			Language 1 
			Science 2 		


 -	Here, JPA GROUP BY clause have grouped the results from the query according to the name of department.

	-	SELECT d.name, COUNT(t) FROM Department dSelects the name of department and total count of teachers.
	-	JOIN d.teachers t Joins Department entity to Teacher entity
	-	GROUP BY d.name This JPA GROUP BY clause groups the results according to name of department. If this clause wasnâ€™t present, then the results would have been grouped as one and not be the department.
