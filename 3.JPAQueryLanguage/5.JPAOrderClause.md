#	JPA ORDER BY clause

-	Sometime we may need to sort the entities in ascending or descending order of some field.
-	JPA ORDER BY clause lets us achieve this.
-	We can sort the entities returned by entity manager according to ascending of descending order of entity fields

		
		
## Order Teacher Entities by their Salary

-	We want to retrieve Teacher entities in sorted order according to their salaries. The query for the same would be

			SELECT t FROM teacher t ORDER BY t.salary;

-	We can execute this using

			String orderBySalaryQuery = "SELECT t FROM Teacher t ORDER BY t.salary";
			Query query = entityManger.createQuery(orderBySalaryQuery);
			List<Teacher> teachers = List<Teacher>query.getResultList();
		
-	This will give output,

			Prasad 20000
			Pranil 20000
			Sushsant 40000
			
-	Order by DESC

			SELECT t FROM Teacher t ORDER BY t.salary DESC
			
-	Output:	
		
			Sushsant 40000
			Prasad 20000
			Pranil 20000
