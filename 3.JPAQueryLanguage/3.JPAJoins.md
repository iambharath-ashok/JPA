#	JPA Joins


-	Inner Joins
-	Outer Joins


##	JPA Inner Joins Example


-	Consider Teacher and Phone entities where there is ManyToOne relationship between Phone and Teacher . i.e. A Teacher can have multiple Phones. They can be represented as follows.

![JPA Inner Joins](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JPA-Inner-joins.png)

		
			Select t FROM teacher t JOIN t.phones p
			
		
-	JOIN keyword says the JPQL consists of an INNER JOIN (as INNER keyword is optional)
-	t.phones  is a path expression that traverses phone numbers of Teacher.
-	p is the identification variable for JPA inner join specified using  t.phones  path expression.		

-	If would like to retrieve phone numbers of the teacher with firstName = "Pranil"and print it out. JPQL would be
	
	
			select t FROM teacher t JOIN t.phones p WHERE t.firstName=:firstName;
			
			Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Teacher t JOIN t.phones p WHERE t.firstName = :firstName");

			query.setParameter("firstName", "Pranil");
			List<Phone> phones = (List<Phone>) query.getResultList();
				for (Phone phone : phones) {
				System.out.println(phone.getNumber());
			}
			
##	JPA Outer Join:


-	The syntax for JPA Outer Join query is as follows.


			LEFT [OUTER] JOIN  <path_expression> [AS] <identifier>

-	LEFT specifies this is LEFT OUTER JOIN
-	OUTER keyword is optional.
-	[AS] is optional and specifies alias for join.			

![JPA Outer Join](http://www.thejavageek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Outer-join.png)

	
			SELECT t FROM Teacher t  JOIN t.department d
			
-	we will get Teacher entities which are assigned to some department. The result is as follows.

			Sushsant belongs To Department [idDepartment=6, name=Mathematics]
			Pranil belongs To Department [idDepartment=8, name=Language]
			
			
-	But what if we want all the teachers irrespective of their belonging to department or not? In this case we need an OUTER join.
-	JPA Outer join of Teacher to Department across the relationship returns all the teachers and the department to which they are assigned. -	This is in contrast with INNER join where only the teachers assigned to some department are returned.

			Query query = em
                .createQuery("SELECT t FROM Teacher t LEFT OUTER  JOIN t.department d");

	        List<Teacher> teachers = (List<Teacher>) query.getResultList();

	        for (Teacher teacher : teachers) {
	            System.out.println(teacher.getFirstName() + " belongs To "
	                    + teacher.getDepartment());
	        }

	
			Prasad belongs To null
			Sushsant belongs To Department [idDepartment=6, name=Mathematics]
			Pranil belongs To Department [idDepartment=8, name=Language]
			

-	Here you can see, a Teacher with name “Prasad” wasn’t included in the results of INNER JOIN query but included in OUTER JOIN query even if it is not assigned to any department.
