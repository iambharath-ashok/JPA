# JPA Case Expression

-	Format of JPA case expression is  as follows


		CASE {WHEN <conditional_expression> THEN <scalar_expression>}+ ELSE <scalar_expression> END
		
		@Entity
		public class Teacher {
		 
			@TableGenerator(name = "teacher_gen", pkColumnName = "gen_name", valueColumnName = "gen_val", table = "id_gen", allocationSize = 1)
			@Id
			@GeneratedValue(generator = "teacher_gen", strategy = GenerationType.TABLE)
			private int idTeacher;
			private String firstName;
			private String lastName;
			private int salary;
		 
			@ManyToOne
			@JoinColumn(name = "idDepartment")
			private Department department;
		 
			@ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
			@JoinTable(name = "teacher_subject", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "idTeacher"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "idSubject"))
			private List<Subject> subjects;
		 
			@OneToMany(mappedBy = "teacher")
			private List<Phone> phones;
		 
		}
		
		
##	Data in Teacher table in database is as follows.


idTeacher|	Firstname|	Lastname|	salary
---------|------------|-----------|------
4	|Sushsant| Pangarkar|40000
3	|Prasad|	Kharkar	|20000
5	|Pranil|	Gilda	|20000

-	Now, salaries of teachers are in int format but we want them in string format for displaying, how can we do that? We can use jpa case expression as follows.
			
			SELECT CASE WHEN t.salary = 20000 THEN '20k' WHEN t.salary = 40000 THEN '40k' ELSE 'No salary' END FROM Teacher t

-	When this query is being processed and executed,

	-	Query processor checks for WHEN clauses and conditional expressions.
	-	WHEN t.salary = 20000 THEN '20k' i.e. we are representing 20000 to 20k as string.
	-	These conditions will get checked against data in the database and corresponding results will be returned.
	
	
			Query caseQuery = em
				.createQuery("SELECT CASE WHEN t.salary = 20000 THEN '20k' WHEN t.salary = 40000 THEN '40k' ELSE 'No salary' END FROM Teacher t");

			List<String> salaries = (List<String>) caseQuery.getResultList();

			for (String salary : salaries) {
				System.out.println(salary);
			}	
			
			
-	Results are printed as follows.

			20k
			40k
			20k
